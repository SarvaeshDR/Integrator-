## Connection Details:
•	Input signal → Resistor (R) → Inverting terminal (Pin 2)
•	Feedback capacitor (Cf) → Between Output (Pin 6) and Pin 2
•	Non-inverting terminal (Pin 3) → Ground
•	Pin 7 → +15V
•	Pin 4 → −15V
## Theory
An Integrator circuit produces an output voltage proportional to the integral of the input voltage.
## Working Principle:
•	When input is constant → output is ramp signal
•	Output is inverted
•	Output depends on time
For Sine Wave Input:
•	Output lags input by 90°
•	Output amplitude decreases with frequency
## Procedure
1.	Open Proteus software.
2.	Select μA741, resistor, capacitor, signal generator, and CRO.
3.	Connect circuit in integrator configuration.
4.	Apply ±15V power supply.
5.	Set input waveform (1V, 1kHz).
6.	Run simulation.
7.	Observe input and output waveforms on CRO.
